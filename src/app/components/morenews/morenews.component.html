              Austasia & Action Sports to define a new leaf in the history of
              Netball for Sri Lanka. Together the team will be working on
              successfully concluding the Inaugural Indoor Netball Tournament
              that is scheduled for the 26th & 27th of November at the Austasia

              The event is a part of the Sports Fiesta that will host 8 other
              sporting events. Shirani Perera, Tournament Director for Badminton
              & Netball indicated that the responses on these events were very
              encouraging. With only few days more, before registrations close
              (10th of November 2011), it is expected that this count will
              continue to grow signifying the keenness of sportsman embracing
              these new concepts in the country.

        “ says Shirani, who is one of Sri Lanka’s most accomplished individuals
        in the fields of Badminton & Netball. Together with Hyacinth, Austasia &
        Action Sports, Shirani will form the quartet that will take on the
        journey of delivering innovative concepts of Netball training to
        Juniors, Seniors and the Umpiring groups of the country.This will be
        undertaken through the Netball Academy that will be launched on the 1st
        week of January 2012 at Austasia International Sports & Leisure Complex,
        Thalawathugoda.“Kids Net” & “Street Netball” are two effective and
        attractive modules that will be covered for the first time in Sri Lanka,
        apart from the standard (outdoor) development work that will be
        undertaken for techniques and skills. A year-round calendar of events
        and training programs will be offered through this Academy. “It would be
        my pleasure to deliver these training modules to the junior kids (upto
        12 years), and observe these modules influencing the outdoor version of
        the game positively” says Hyacinth who has undertaken similar workshops
        and sessions in Singapore and Malaysia. She also possesses the
        qualifications to do so in Sri Lanka through her course work undertaken
        in Singapore. For further details relating to the Sport Fiesta or the
